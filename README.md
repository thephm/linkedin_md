# linkedin_md

This tool takes the CSV output file from the LinkedIn export and generates a set of Markdown files on your filesystem. 

## message_md dependency

The code in this repo relies heavily on my [message_md](https://github.com/thephm/message_md) classes which contain generic `Message`, `Person`, `Group` and other classes and the methods to convert messages to Markdown files. Be sure to read the [README](https://github.com/thephm/message_md/blob/main/README.md) and the configuration [guide](https://github.com/thephm/message_md/blob/main/docs/guide.md) for that repo first.
